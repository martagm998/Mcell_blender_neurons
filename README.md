# Mcell_blender_neurons
This is a university project. Neuronal sinapsis model in mcell_blender

Simulation of a chemical sinapsis. A neurotransmisor, the glutamate, will be released from the presinaptic neuron to a specific receptor AMPA located in the postsinaptic neuron. 
Output:
- glutamate concentration
- number of receptors AMPA opened


You will need to install MCELL and cellblender
